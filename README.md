# Sorting
A repo of different sorting algorithms written in C/C++.
Directions to use all executables can be found within the program files.

Currently have bubble, selection, insertion, quick, and merge sorts.

Use generate_file.c to create text files of any length, filled with random values.

I recommend creating a tests directory where you can put all of your generated test files in the top directory.
Then put an output directory in all algorithm subdirectories.
